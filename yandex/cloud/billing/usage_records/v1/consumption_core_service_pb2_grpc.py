    """Service for detailed consumption and usage reporting.

    The ConsumptionCoreService provides a comprehensive set of methods for retrieving detailed
    usage and billing information for different entities within a billing account hierarchy.
    Each method offers aggregated data for specific entity types (a billing account, clouds,
    folders, services, SKUs, resources, or labels) with support for various filtering options
    and aggregation periods. Note that each request targets a single billing account.

    All methods in this service follow the same three-level response structure:
    1. Overall totals for the entire request period (cost, credits, expense)
    2. Entity-level totals - summary data for each entity of the requested type
    3. Time series data - periodic breakdown for each entity according to the specified aggregation period
    (controlled by the aggregation_period request parameter: day/week/month/quarter/year)

    These methods help customers and internal teams analyze usage patterns, track expenses,
    monitor resource consumption, and generate detailed billing reports. The service
    supports filtering by entity IDs, date ranges, labels, and other parameters to provide
    targeted insights into cloud resource usage.
