# Yandex.Cloud SDK (Python) 

Need to automate your infrastructure or use services provided by Yandex.Cloud? We've got you covered.

Installation:

    pip install yandexcloud

## Getting started

There are several options for authorization your requests - OAuth Token,
Metadata Service (if you're executing code inside VMs or Functions
running in Yandex.Cloud) and Service Account Keys

### OAuth Token

```python
sdk = yandexcloud.SDK(token='AQAD-.....')
```

### Metadata Service

Don't forget to assign Service Account for your Instance or Function and grant required roles.

```python
sdk = yandexcloud.SDK()
```

### Service Account Keys

```python
# you can store and read it from JSON file 
sa_key = {
    "id": "...",
    "service_account_id": "...",
    "private_key": "..."
}

sdk = yandexcloud.SDK(service_account_key=sa_key)
```

Check `examples` directory for more examples.
